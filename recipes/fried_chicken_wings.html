            <h2> Description</h2>

                <li> 1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
                <li> 1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
                <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                <li> 2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
                <li> 1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle Buffalo wing sauce ( such as Frank's), or to taste</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <h2> Steps</h2>
            <ol>

                <li> Gather all ingredients</li>
                <li> Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt</li>
                <li> Mix flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika together in a wide, shallow
                     bowl. Press wings into flour mixture to coat and arrange in a single layer on a 
                     large plate. Refrigerate coated wings for 15 to 30 minutes.
                    </li>
                <li> Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate
                    wings once more for 15b to 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li> Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F ( 190 degrees C )</li>
                <li> Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and juices run clear, 10 to 12 minutes.
                    An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, near the 
                    bone, should read 165 degrees F ( 74 degrees C). 
                </li>
                <li> Transfer fried wings to a large bowl. Drizzle sauce over wings and toss to coat.</li>
                <li> Serve and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
